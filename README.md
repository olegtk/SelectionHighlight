This extension will highlight all occurrences of a selected with a mouse or keyboard word in the current document and display a glyph on the left margin.This allows for fast visualization of a specific word used throughout the document, including ones in comments.

Works similar as it was implemented in Notepad++

Steps:

1. Install the extension and verified that it is enabled in the Tools->Extension Manager.
2. In the editor window, select a word with a mouse (i.e. by double click) or keyboard.  

All occurrences of the word selected should be highlighted in the current document.

I have only modified the manifest file to support Visual studio 2017
